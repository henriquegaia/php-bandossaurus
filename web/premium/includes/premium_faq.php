            Is this a long-term commitment?
        </h3>
        <p>
            No. It's a pay-as-you-go service. You can cancel any time via one click on this page. If you cancel, you'll be able to use paid features till the end of the paid month (30 days since your last payment).

            What payment types do you accept?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Currently we accept PayPal. At this time we only accept payments online so we will not be able to accept a P.O., invoice you, or take an order over the phone.
