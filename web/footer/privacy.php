    example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our

    You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil
    action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give
    you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also
    proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief
    that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a
